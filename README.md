# PROJECT-9
The History Hub is a responsive blog-style website built using HTML, CSS. This project is designed to showcase museum history, cultural heritage, and travel-related content in a clean and visually appealing layout. It features a modern homepage with a hero section, navigation menu, social media links, and blog post cards for displaying articles.

The main objective of this project is to practice front-end development concepts such as layout design, responsive web structure, image positioning, and content presentation. While working on this project, I improved my skills in building multi-section websites, organizing content, and creating user-friendly interfaces. This project is intended for learning and practice purposes and reflects my progress in web development.
