         Town Planners organized an architecture competition to select a design
         for the landmark.The concept was simple: the monument had to signify a
         sovereign state and the strength of its people. More than 21
         architects from across the country submitted their proposals. The
         council shortlisted three of them. However, the honour of designing 
         the Pakistan Monument went to Arif Masoud.The monument was completed 
         in 2006 under the supervision of Engineer Syed Mahmud Khalid. The 
         inauguration ceremony was held on 23rd March 2007. It covers 2.8 
         hectares of land and holds the first position on the list of national
